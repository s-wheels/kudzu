The outputs of the loss function are the metric through which the model sees the world and the system it is trying to mimic, and tell it if it is improving or worsening.

If this reality check mirrors reality poorly, then it follows that the trained model will also perform poorly when working on real data.\n",

This is far from an exhaustive list, but contains many of the most common and reapplicable loss functions. When you are considering your problem you must always carefully consider what model you want and what is the most useful model, which depending on your real-world problem, may not always be the model with the highest accuracy! Coming up with bespoke loss functions for problems can often yield a more useful model, and is something that should be considered."
